People. Good afternoon. Who's gonna go first? Yeah, Serena, you've had injuries. You took a year out to have a child?  start= 16.26 end=23.209
Well, you're still making finals. Uh, where do you find the inner strength to keep competing at this level?  start= 23.42 end=29.94
Um, I don't know, I was thinking about it other, been to a lot of semis and finals since I came back from the baby.  start= 32.76 end=39.08
So, um, yeah, I don't know, I just, I just felt like if I could just get some matches,  start= 42.65 end=47.779
I could have, I could play well here and I did. So I am Serena, start=50.79 end=55.84
an elite athlete like you. Uh, again and again,  start= 53.02 end=58.9
faces pressure moments and big landmarks. Uh, obviously you've had this number 24 in front of you for a little while. start=62.779 end=67.91
How do you yourself deal with handling that?  start= 64.61 end=71.66
Pressure, handling the hopes of, of reaching that mark? Um, you know, I thought about it this morning and I actually didn't think about it since,  start= 74.05 end=82.699
um, because it's really not about 24 or 23 or 25. start=83.819 end=89.239
It's really just about going out there and giving my best effort no matter what and, start=89.25 end=95.889
um, no matter what I do I will always have a great career and,  start= 95.40 end=101.41
um, I don't know, like I just kind of let it go this morning and, yeah, I feel really calm about it.  start= 103.77 end=108.959
Uh, everything you did today seemed to work well, but in terms of the way you seem to volley really well and pick up the short balls really well.  start= 111.00 end=117.72
Can we attribute that to your doubles? Uh, I promise you when I hit a volley,  start= 119.73 end=125.04
I was like, would I have made that if I didn't play doubles? I don't think so. So, um I kept telling you guys,  start= 125.40 end=131.279
I really think the doubles will help me and I definitely think it did. I mean, I don't attack the net that much and I try to and I want to and I know like when I do, start=135.63 end=141.97
like when I play doubles here with Venus,  start= 138.32 end=143.619
like it definitely helps my singles game and I was really keen to play mixed here and um I really feel like it helped me. start=143.75 end=150.49
So, and, you know, not just for today and for this event, but just hopefully it'll help me just in the future to the back.  start= 150.91 end=158.169
How much is. Um So you served extra being with in, in the, in the doubles,  start= 159.33 end=165.13
maybe that's extra uh doubles for playing the doubles earlier. Um You were able to do more serves.  start= 166.03 end=174.119
Has that helped and where are you in terms of your best serves and where you can get to. start=174.13 end=180.36
Um I don't know. I feel like, I don't know if I've had my best service tournament.  start= 182.59 end=188.55
I've had some big ones, but, um, I'm just now starting to use my legs again. Well,  start= 188.94 end=194.449
two weeks ago in the tournament. So then I was like, oh my God, I forgot about my serve and it was kind of back and so it felt good.  start= 194.49 end=202.809
So it's just really about rediscovering my technique or my serve and how I use my body and how I use every part of it. start=202.82 end=209.479
And uh and just really know that I can still improve. Uh Serena congrats.  start= 211.61 end=217.419
Uh some players here have been talking about the grass being slower at center core, start=217.429 end=222.85
uh in particular, I mean, you had no problem hitting through today, but did you feel the grass was a little slower?  start= 222.89 end=229.1
I am definitely not the right player to ask for that. So, unless it's like a extreme dramatic difference,  start= 230.13 end=237.21
then, you know, I'm from Compton and everything is like amazing. So, yeah, this is your third final in the last 13 months or so of a grand slam.  start= 243.26 end=251.419
I'm curious what you take from the previous two in terms of what you've learned from them and all your approach changes going into this next attempt. start=251.429 end=259.85
Um Yeah, I had uh to get to those finals, like looking back to even be in those two finals last year was unbelievable. start=264.32 end=270.5
Um And now I'm in a different place like I just am more calm and,  start= 266.88 end=275.25
um, instead of having nothing to lose, I feel like I have things to lose but I also have nothing to lose.  start= 275.94 end=282.339
It's like I'm in the middle. Um, and I, and I really wanted to do it, you know, um,  start= 282.80 end=287.899
and I'm in a different place because I wasn't really playing a month ago, start=288.16 end=293.399
like, at all. Um, so it's just all kind of coming together. I can't really put how I'm taking it is a 30 something pursuing this title. start=298.989 end=305.929
What are the differences from your emotions when you won your first Wimbledon title?  start= 300.98 end=310.0
Yeah, I actually thought about that this morning. I was thinking that when I won my first Wimbledon, I think it was against Venus and I was trying to tap into those emotions and um I was really calm and I remember, start=315.29 end=323.7
I think I hit an ace.  start= 318.81 end=325.0
Um, and I just remember like how it's so, so different when you're younger as opposed to,  start= 325.48 end=332.47
to now and, but now I just need to, like I said the other day, just relax and just do what I can do.  start= 332.86 end=338.89
But you just said you're very calm now. So maybe you're returning to how you felt back then.  start= 338.98 end=344.73
I was calm today. It's a day to day basis with me. We all know that. So I'm far from perfect.  start= 346.78 end=353.709
So can you talk about, can you talk about the dejection, the devastation of losing the final 12 months ago and presumably,  start= 354.26 end=360.269
do you feel you're serving a lot better than you were, say the last, final, last run. Um I don't remember much.  start= 361.11 end=368.399
I just remember I was really tired and Angel and Angie played unbelievable and I actually, start=368.41 end=375.059
I was sad, but I was also proud of myself and um it was nothing I could do in that match. start=376.1 end=382.029
Like I just, I did everything I could and physically, I just wasn't there.  start= 381.04 end=386.17
And I remember after that I just trained and I trained and I trained to get physically more fit. start=386.179 end=391.23
Um, so I'm definitely at a different place. I mean, yeah, I didn't have the preparation coming into Wimbledon of training for two weeks even. start=395.04 end=401.359
Um So that would have been nice,  start= 398.92 end=405.279
but now I have to look at a different place because I, I have been just this whole year just trying to stay fit so I can be able to play in Grand Slams from what you've said, start=407.799 end=416.54
Serena, you did. You've been doing quite a lot of thinking this morning.  start= 414.07 end=419.5
How often do you have these contemplative? Never. I don't know, I don't know just what brings them on.  start= 419.85 end=425.859
I don't know what brought it on. I just was, I don't know. Yeah, I never usually think about it but to the questions that you all asked,  start= 428.14 end=436.079
I literally was thinking about those things this morning and um just trying to tap into that younger Serena and trying to tap into that, start=436.089 end=443.529
you know, the um how to win, basically liberate meditative thing or is it just thoughts that come into your head?  start= 443.88 end=451.329
It was definitely deliberate. And then, um as I was thinking, other thoughts were popping in my brain,  start= 451.51 end=457.69
Serena, last week, you were supported by your friend, the Duchess of Sussex in the early rounds.  start= 459.55 end=464.649
Um It drew a bit of criticism as well. Um at the time, do you hope that she'll come and support you in the final and sort of ignore all that sort of negative media publicity that have happened. start=469.13 end=475.88
Um You know, I don't,  start= 472.79 end=478.079
I didn't know there was negative media out there. I don't really, any time I see her name attached to anything.  start= 478.20 end=483.839
I don't read it. Um, she's, she couldn't be a better friend to me.  start= 484.52 end=490.179
Um, low moments, high moments, she's always there and that's all I wanna be to her.  start= 490.78 end=496.67
Ok. Hi Serena. There was a lot of talk earlier this week about the questioning that Johanna Conte had faced after her loss in the quarterfinal. start=499.799 end=505.01
I just wonder what you thought. Um, a lot of, there was a lot of discussion um following Johanna Conte's loss in the quarterfinals about the questioning that she faced in the press conference afterwards. start=508.23 end=516.179
I just wonder what you thought about the situation or the questioning that she faced.  start= 513.33 end=520.099
I know she said she felt she was patronized. Um I, I have to apologize. I really step away from the tennis.  start= 520.64 end=528.51
Um, when I'm away from it I do know there's, it could be a lot of negativity and I don't want to surround myself around that.  start= 529.37 end=536.26
Um You know, I feel like she's had a remarkable year and if anything, start=538.08 end=543.13
everyone should be happy for her and especially what she's done in the past 12 months, start=543.14 end=548.609
um just changing her, coming back around and changing and coming back to be like semifinals of the French open and then quarterfinals here. start=550.969 end=557.89
So I would only think that it should have been positive questions,  start= 554.38 end=561.13
but that's not the case at a lot of the time and hopefully everyone can learn from them. start=561.14 end=566.219
Serena Simona Halep has done some pretty cool stuff in the last couple of years and longer than that as well. start=567.369 end=573.33
Finishing two years in a row is number one winning a slam. All that stuff. I'm wondering now she's even in the th she's made the slam finals in three of the four slams. start=576.63 end=581.96
I'm wondering for you, what's the most impressive thing about her and what do you make of what she's managed to accomplish so far?  start= 578.71 end=587.119
Um There's so many impressive things about her. I think obviously her tenacity,  start= 588.06 end=595.549
I think um her ability to improve every time, you know, and just to keep improving um her ability to find power um and just can't underestimate her. start=599.679 end=607.95
She's like she's like a little powerhouse and um she just obviously she, start=607.96 end=615.219
yeah, she finished the year number one twice in a row and I feel like she's back and she wants to prove that she can do it again. start=615.26 end=622.83
Mhm Serena,  start= 619.84 end=624.979
when you spoke about being calm and just the calm that sort of possessed you today is that when, start=625.0 end=630.57
you know, things are clicking for you, when you feel that kind of equilibrium and calm, does that settle you and,  start= 630.61 end=635.969
and, and make you play better? I definitely feel like I play better when I'm calm but it's definitely a, an effort.  start= 637.47 end=643.19
Um, not getting over pumped, but at the same time not getting underwhelmed. So I have to just be in that,  start= 644.12 end=650.33
that right space. What do you think, uh, has been the key to your success against Simona in past matches? start=656.02 end=661.77
And what, uh, sticks out in your mind from the match in Australia,  start= 658.92 end=666.32
uh against her the last time you played, I think the biggest key, um, with our matches is the loss that I had.  start= 667.75 end=673.429
I never forgot it and she played unbelievable. And that makes me know that,  start= 673.74 end=678.849
that level that she played at, she can get there again. And so I have to be better than that.  start= 679.75 end=684.75
The back Serena. Congratulations. I want to ask you so much of us are talking about the history that you could make this weekend. start=688.32 end=693.429
Uh, the, the history as far as your age.  start= 691.34 end=696.429
I don't know if the 37 is the new 27 or whatever, but can you talk about the fact that you are doing it at this age,  start= 696.45 end=703.44
what it says about you, what it says about people being able to compete at older ages than they have in the past. start=705.09 end=710.39
Um I think technology has really changed and that's the only reason I'm able to compete.  start= 709.80 end=715.669
I feel like if we had this technology 20 years ago, maybe Michael Jordan would still be playing basketball.  start= 715.69 end=722.13
Um But I just feel like we know so much more about our bodies, things I do different now than when I first was on tour and it's lengthen my career and not just me, start=727.049 end=734.359
there's Roger and there's um Tom Brady and there's, start=734.369 end=739.469
I mean, Peyton played forever.  start= 735.03 end=741.51
So there's so many athletes now that are able to do better and um and play longer and even play some of their best in their way after thirties and those athletes and Tiger, start=741.609 end=755.27
obviously, what he did at the masters was on top of my mind. Um Those athletes are incredibly inspiring and,  start= 755.67 end=764.299
you know, it just, that's one thing that keeps me moving forward. Um First of all, I would like to say that I like your outfit today and I'd like to know if in the morning with all your thoughts, start=771.109 end=777.409
you start thinking what you're going to wear for the press conference afterwards.  start= 772.57 end=781.169
If you grab it at the last minute before you come here, how does it work if someone else chooses for you or you do it?  start= 781.23 end=788.52
And second from an Italian fashion point of view. I must say that here you are much more elegant than anywhere else you should always bring with.  start= 788.87 end=796.679
You know, I made a conscious effort to up my press conference look and like my Nike gear. Um my um right hand Dakota picked out my outfits but I prepare like the night before. start=803.7 end=812.929
So I kind of try them on and you're like,  start= 807.98 end=815.169
hm, this looks cute. This looks nice. How do I wear this? Um, definitely not the day of like,  start= 817.63 end=824.179
that's too much pressure. Two more questions. Uh, Serena, uh uh Philip Brook is, it's his last year.  start= 828.24 end=834.299
He's the chairman of Wimble London and he has been in our gracious host with his wife Jill and some players just had, start=834.309 end=841.82
they share some uh interactions, uh they had with him. Do you have anything to,  start= 841.85 end=847.14
to say that he is always smiling? start=847.739 end=853.08
You know, I just love it. Does I see him in Australia? I see him in New York.  start= 853.38 end=858.63
I see him everywhere and I literally will be on the court and I swear I see him smiling and that is such a good moment in memory to have of Philip. start=858.64 end=869.15
I didn't know it was his last year. Oh, is it? Oh, so that's,  start= 872.50 end=877.77
it's sad. But, um, he's just really made my Wimbledon experience.  start= 878.38 end=883.469
How long has he, has he been here? Like, has it been 10 years because I remember the guy before?  start= 884.21 end=889.65
It's time to go? Wow. Ok. So, yeah. Um,  start= 897.23 end=902.429
Yeah, I just remember, I, I, I love, I really love him and his wife Jill is amazing.  start= 902.77 end=908.02
And, uh, it's, I just love seeing him like he'll pass my practice court and he just has this great big smile on his face and it really makes me feel welcome every year. start=909.809 end=917.07
Last question. Last year after the final, you gave a really impassioned speech and,  start= 917.05 end=923.25
and I, I don't wanna get this wrong but to paraphrase, you said something like to all the mothers out there, this was for you.  start= 923.29 end=928.76
And that's really been a theme of the past year, especially last year when you walk out on Sunday.  start= 928.78 end=933.799
Who were you playing this one for? Um, I don't know. I mean, I'm just playing for me and last year was a really special moment.  start= 935.23 end=943.01
Oh, my God. Olympia was 10 months. She's not even two yet. So,  start= 943.33 end=948.609
yeah. So for that, it was definitely a different moment. Um, you know, so it's a different experience and I'm happy to be back in this experience.  start= 951.37 end=960.669
I definitely wouldn't have predicted it a month ago, but here I am. And so I'm playing for everyone that didn't predict it a month ago.  start= 960.70 end=969.57
Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for this as well. Yeah. Right. I see.  start= 983.87 end=987.059

This just then Tiger was stepping to the mic at the press building, getting ready for the masters,  start= 2.52 end=8.25
take a listen through this. Um Kobe's really been there through thick and thin to help me get into this position and it's, start=9.35 end=15.369
uh, it's a daily adoption. Uh We work at it each and every day.  start= 14.93 end=20.1
Um Whether it's uh trying to loosen me up or strengthen me or it's just recovery. start=20.11 end=27.35
Um My, my practice sessions certainly aren't what they used to be. I used to, you know,  start= 27.64 end=32.669
live on the range or live on a short game facility and just be there all day. Uh That's no longer the case.  start= 32.69 end=38.939
And so I just have to be more focused on when I do get a chance to go out there and practice and, start=38.95 end=44.209
uh really grind out and make every shot count. Um, because I just really don't have the ball count in me anymore.  start= 44.75 end=50.389
So, uh those adaptations of, um, you know, hopefully I've made them for this week,  start= 51.11 end=56.74
I've got a chance to go out there on Sunday. Take a look at the front nine. I played yesterday with Will on the back nine and,  start= 56.94 end=63.189
uh, came out today and played the front nine again with uh J T and Fred. So, uh this golf courses when we came up here,  start= 63.84 end=70.43
when, when we came up here last weekend, uh it was in perfect shape and it's only gotten better, which is uh hard to believe,  start= 70.92 end=77.69
but it, it has and, and hopefully we will uh you know, get the weather cooperated a little bit with us.  start= 78.77 end=84.489
Uh Come Thursday, Taylor, let's open the questions with Taylor. And if you would please lean into the microphone to state your question,  start= 85.86 end=92.25
Taylor Tiger, given those physical challenges that I just described, why is it so important for you to keep playing in this tournament?  start= 92.66 end=101.47
Well, this term has meant so much to me in my life and my, my family. Um I've,  start= 102.36 end=107.75
I think I've been playing here for tw 29 years now and it has uh it was the ultimate to be able to stay in the, start=108.639 end=116.58
the crow's nest and to watch Byron and Sam and Gene tee off on the, start=116.589 end=122.33
on the first hole. Um And it's been a part of my life,  start= 122.76 end=128.029
you know, to have one here as the, my first major as, as a pro um hugging my dad as you saw and then full circle in 19 the, start=133.479 end=139.99
you know,  start= 135.03 end=140.169
hug my son. Uh It has meant a lot to my family. Um It's meant a lot to me and uh I always want to keep playing in this and today we got a chance to play with Fred and Fred's been here, start=143.889 end=152.21
you know, a very long time. And, uh,  start= 149.91 end=155.0
we're joking that, you know, he's the oldest person ever to make a older person, ever make a cut.  start= 155.37 end=160.6
Uh, and I think he can do it again this year. So, it's, it's great. I mean, that, that's,  start= 161.45 end=166.55
that's the neat thing about this golf course and that's the only major we play on the same site, the same venue each and every year and we get to tell stories and,  start= 166.57 end=174.24
um, catch up with friends and, um, for me get a chance to catch up with the idols and the people that I've,  start= 174.67 end=180.929
I've looked up to my entire life. Zach Glenn, please. Hey, Tiger, what would a record 24 straight cuts mean to you at this event?  start= 182.97 end=190.199
Considering all the major accomplishments you've had in your career? Yeah, I think it's, well, it's consistency. It's longevity and it's,  start= 190.38 end=197.149
uh, understanding of how to play this golf course. Uh, that's one of the reasons why you see players that are in their fifties and sixties make cuts here or it's, start=202.149 end=208.71
uh, players in their, you know, late,  start= 206.49 end=211.72
late forties have runs at winning the event. It's just on the understanding of how to play it. No, you still have to go out and execute it.  start= 211.88 end=218.47
Um, but there's a lot of knowledge that goes into, um, understanding how to play it and granted,  start= 219.30 end=226.74
you know, the E every T box has been changed since the first time I played, every green has been, been changed.  start= 227.59 end=233.0
Um, but the overall configuration of how they roll and how they move and the angles you take that hasn't changed. start=234.47 end=241.619
Um, that's a, that's a neat thing about this. I can still go into the, the mental rolodex and bring out a few putts from the nineties that,  start= 241.63 end=249.699
that still move generally in that direction. And, uh, the fact that Race Creek has on, on certain shots and puts and,  start= 250.20 end=256.67
um, it, it means a lot, Jeff Shackelford, uh Tiger two things. What have you seen of the golf course?  start= 259.77 end=266.32
And some of the changes since last year? And is there any particular lie with the severity of some of the,  start= 266.34 end=273.45
the tilt to the ground here, either uphill or downhill? That's, that's tricky for you with your, your ankle.  start= 273.50 end=278.739
Uh, let's see, two has been lengthened a little bit. I think it's 33,  start= 279.57 end=285.07
13 or 3, 11 from the plate to the bunker. Um, four has been resurfaced. Uh, it's some of the putts,  start= 286.96 end=293.97
they, they've widened the top right of it. The, the bottoms of the back left is a little bit steeper. Um,  start= 294.02 end=299.5
some of the putts from the bottom move a little bit differently and six is a little bit different too with, start=299.549 end=304.69
uh, the addition of a little bit more room on the top right, and the elevation of the back back of the green So the,  start= 305.56 end=311.489
that little chip chat we had is a little bit different now, um, over the back, back part of the green and because there's more room on that,  start= 312.01 end=319.1
that shelf, it doesn't feel like that you're crowded with two people on top of that shelf. Uh There's a little bit more room now,  start= 319.32 end=324.609
as far as my physicality on certain shots, uh, every shot that's not on the T box is a,  start= 327.63 end=334.559
is a, is a challenge. So, yeah, once, once we start the whole, it's, it's a bit of a challenge. Doug Ferguson and you said last year,  start= 336.47 end=344.42
your, your hope or your ambition was to try and play once a month or you have some limitations. start=344.779 end=349.92
I'm just curious what specifically, um, determines whether, whether you play what kept you from,  start= 349.91 end=356.019
you know, since playing from r Well, I wasn't ready to play. Um, my, my body wasn't ready,  start= 356.84 end=361.94
my game wasn't ready and I thought that, you know, when I was at Hero,  start= 361.97 end=367.42
you know, once a month was, would be a very nice rhythm. Um, hasn't worked out that way. Um But now we have major championships every month,  start= 368.96 end=376.029
you know, from here through July. So, um, now the once a month that hopefully kicks in Bob Herrick Tiger, start=379.48 end=385.51
just wanna follow up on that. Was there any physical issues that kept you from preparing the way you would have wanted to in the past,  start= 382.83 end=391.769
you know, a month ago to play in Florida and where are you in that regard? Right now? The body is just,  start= 392.11 end=397.619
uh you know, the things that just flare up. Um And as a, again,  start= 398.45 end=403.679
the training that we have to do at home, it, it changes from a day to day basis. Um Some days I just feel really good and other days not so much.  start= 403.84 end=413.16
Uh, next would be uh Mr Jacques Patterson Tiger with everything that you go through in your career right now. start=415.14 end=422.079
What makes you get up and go through all the preparation and all the, you know, the things you have to go through to get ready to play top level major golf.  start= 422.09 end=430.57
I love golf. I do. I've, I've, I've always loved it. Um, I, I played other sports growing up but I just have always loved the sport and I'd love to compete and be able to have the love I have for the game and the love for competition be intertwined. start=435.25 end=453.649
Um, I think that's one of the reasons why I've had a successful career.  start= 451.08 end=457.519
Uh, I just love doing the work. Uh, I love logging the time in and I love preparing. I love competing and I love that feeling when,  start= 458.19 end=465.399
um, everything is on fire with a chance to win. And, uh, you either do or don't Jimmy Roberts.  start= 466.52 end=474.149
Hi Tiger. Um, you talked a bunch about your local knowledge and it's obviously considerable after all these years. start=476.44 end=482.63
Is there any way to quantify how many strokes around that might be worth to you on an average around. start=482.64 end=490.26
I, I don't know if it's, it's quantifiable but I can tell you that understanding where to miss it is. start=492.029 end=497.75
I mean, granted you're gonna get some weird wind pop up and hit spots but understanding of where to miss it, start=498.42 end=508.25
how to miss it and the shot shape to put it there.  start= 505.37 end=510.69
Um, I, I don't know what the exact number would be. Um but it is helpful and that's one of the reasons why it's always helpful to play with.  start= 512.05 end=520.219
Um, players have had success here and players that have, you know, played the test of time, especially the past champions,  start= 521.36 end=527.27
Kevin right here. Sorry. Oh, sorry. Down here, I think last year you talked a little bit about bringing your son here and sharing memories and stuff with him.  start= 530.27 end=537.88
How often do you bring him here to play? And how often does he ask to come? Uh We haven't,  start= 537.92 end=543.02
we haven't played in a couple of years now. Um I came up here last weekend. Uh he uh wanted to be at home,  start= 543.21 end=550.34
so I came up here and, and came up and got a chance to play with uh the chairman and,  start= 550.36 end=555.83
and Rob and J T and we had just an absolute blast, you know, I would like to obviously play a little bit more up here with him.  start= 556.19 end=563.359
Uh and to share the experiences, you know, especially now that he's got a little bit longer. So, uh he hits it past me.  start= 564.31 end=570.77
So I think that uh the, the days of playing for the members teams are over, he's gotta come back there with us.  start= 570.80 end=576.57
Dan Riddell Barger. When you think of everywhere you've been everything you've achieved and the life you've had.  start= 578.28 end=583.979
What does the game of golf mean to you? Uh Well, it's been my life,  start= 585.26 end=592.15
you know, I've, I've, I have, I started playing nine months so I've, I've done it pretty much my entire life and,  start= 594.97 end=602.7
uh, played my first tournament when I was five and have been playing tournament golf and playing golf around the world, start=602.729 end=612.7
not just here in the United States, but around the world is it allowed me to, to see places that I don't think that I've ever,  start= 612.72 end=619.01
I've gotten a chance to see, uh, people that I've got a chance to meet all around the world. Um,  start= 620.08 end=625.27
this and, and the, the generational connectivity with the board, right? And so, um,  start= 625.88 end=631.289
as I said, with, you know, watching Sam and Gene, um and Byron tee off to the,  start= 632.77 end=640.82
you know, two years later to watch them drinking my milkshakes, um to play, practice around with Fred and Raymond and Sey,  start= 641.61 end=648.549
you know, over the years, I mean, th those are, and, and Jack and Arnold, you know, tho those are memories that I'll have for a lifetime and it's all because of the sport and Tiger. start=652.669 end=659.46
Can you talk about what it means?  start= 656.16 end=661.409
To you to mentor younger players, we know what it means to them. But how about any kind of joy that you might get doing that?  start= 661.44 end=669.789
I, I, I love watching them succeed. You know, that, that's, that's part of the game is we, we, we pass on the knowledge we,  start= 669.88 end=675.349
we don't keep it. Um All the, the players that have come before me, I,  start= 675.83 end=681.15
I really didn't really discover anything new is the fact that they were able to share a lot of that with me. start=681.159 end=687.309
Um And then, you know, that's what we do. We, we pass on the knowledge to the next generation and especially here,  start= 687.92 end=695.96
you know, that's one of the events that we get a chance to do that just because we're playing on the same venue, you know, every, each and every year we're able to pass that on.  start= 696.01 end=701.789
And I think the Masters does an incredible job of bringing together um, start=702.26 end=707.469
the past and the future uh of the game of golf. Mr Murray. I, what's your current position regarding the,  start= 712.02 end=718.739
the Ryder Cup cabin again, your current position regarding the Ryder Cup cab at Beth page? Ok.  start= 720.25 end=725.289
What, what is it? Uh We're, we're still talking about it. Is it linked to how much you're going to play golf? I,  start= 727.96 end=733.19
I it's something that Seth and I are gonna sit back and, and talk about it after this event. Um I said I'm gonna be busy for a couple of weeks So,  start= 733.49 end=741.119
uh, let me focus on getting through this week and hopefully getting another jacket and then we can sit back and talk about next week. start=741.15 end=748.27
Mary Kate. Hey Tiger. Um, just curious over here up here, over here.  start= 751.98 end=756.989
Right. Right. Yes. Got it. Sorry. Now you're good. Can you describe the feeling you get when you return to this property and get to put on your green jacket? start=760.619 end=765.669
Um, it's special, uh, to come down Magnolia Lane the first time I,  start= 767.22 end=773.89
I got a chance to see it. I came in the and in the middle of the night we, we played a Stanford Georgia Tech event.  start= 773.92 end=781.14
Um So I came in the middle of the night and I didn't get a chance to see Magnolia Lane, start=781.53 end=787.21
the, the, the F F my first time, right? So, um got a chance to stay in the crow's nest and the next day got a chance to see the golf course and you know what, start=790.119 end=799.32
what this amazing property is and the just, start=799.33 end=806.169
uh the, the fact that I'm able to put on a green jacket for the rest of my life,  start= 804.35 end=810.21
um is just absolutely amazing and, uh I'm, I'm just an honorary member,  start= 810.25 end=815.95
but, um I love it.  start= 815.98 end=817.419

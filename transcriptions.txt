we meet again, we meet again as we meet so often after these title winds. do I ask you something?  start= 3.32 end=8.84
Or you're gonna tell me something anyway? Expected if you ask. And then I reply. I ask you when you last won a trophy about the legacy you leave behind that CSK and you said I had left it behind yet So you're looking for an answer. start=12.75 end=22.2
You know, if you circumstantially if you see,  start= 18.32 end=25.04
this is the best time for me to announce the retirement, you know, But, uh, the amount of love and affection that I've been shown wherever I have been this year,  start= 25.07 end=34.19
you know, I think the easy thing for me, For me to say it would be like, thank you very much.  start= 34.21 end=39.57
But the tough thing for me is to work hard for another nine months and come back and play at least one more season of five years. start=39.57 end=45.88
but a lot. A lot depends on the body. You have 767 months to decide.  start= 46.51 end=52.11
I think you know it's something. It will be more like a gift from my side. It's not easy for me,  start= 52.71 end=58.59
but you know, that's a gift the way they have shown their love and affection. I think that's something that I need to do for them.  start= 58.60 end=63.99
normally a mess. You don't show any emotion when you win or lose. The other day when I was doing an interview with you in In,  start= 64.59 end=70.94
uh, for the first time, I got the impression as you were looking up at the crowd that I thought you showed a little bit of emotion.  start= 70.96 end=76.85
Well, you do get emotional, you know, for a simple fact that it's the last part of my career and I think it started over here, start=78.76 end=83.77
You know what I mean? I'm playing the first game. I just walked down and,  start= 81.89 end=87.29
you know, the full house was chanting my name, you know, my eyes actually filled with water and I just stood They're in the back out for a while and I took my time and I realised that I want to enjoy it and not take that pressure. start=89.78 end=99.535
And I think it was same thing in tonight. It was my last game over there,  start= 97.07 end=103.545
but it'll be good to come back and play whatever I can How do you stay grounded and all that is happening when people are chanting your name everywhere you go, start=103.555 end=113.8
how do you stay grounded? I think they love me for who I am. And you know, being grounded is something that they really liking me.  start= 113.83 end=121.43
Also, the fact that the kind of cricket I play you know, everyone in the stadium, they feel they can play that kind of cricket,  start= 121.45 end=127.93
you know, because there's nothing orthodox about it. So So I feel, you know, they can relate to me more than anyone else.  start= 127.94 end=134.01
That's the reason. But again, as I said, you know, I don't want to change myself. I I never wanted to portray myself in a way,  start= 134.22 end=140.36
which I'm not, so I just like to keep it simple. You won almost everything. There is to be one in our game,  start= 140.39 end=146.83
including this 14 times before. Is there something about this one with the team that you had Is there anything special about this particular one? start=149.5 end=156.73
I think every every trophy that you are in a very bilateral series that you win it,  start= 154.09 end=161.12
especially in its own way. You have your own challenges. And, of course, we play a team game, you know, so that the whole team needs to be up there.  start= 161.14 end=167.31
What really is fascinating about I pl is you know, when it comes to the crunch game, that's the time,  start= 167.34 end=172.9
and you want your individuals to be ready, and I feel you know, that's something that we have done.  start= 173.09 end=178.36
But there have been lapses. You know, we have not talked about a lot about today's game, but I don't I don't think we started at the at the right way,  start= 178.37 end=186.16
and throughout the game there were lapses that was produced, you know, But I feel again, you know, we came back when the bowling department was when they didn't do their work.  start= 186.17 end=194.67
It was a batting department that took the pressure of them I was speaking to a lot of your teammates, start=194.68 end=199.75
and the one thing they said specifically was M s gives us a role and backs us to fulfil that role. start=199.75 end=207.88
Is it always like that? You go through moments of frustration. You have given you that role, but you're not doing it.  start= 207.90 end=213.02
I spoke about Rouhani, Ambati Radio Marginally. All these people, you took them with you right through the season.  start= 213.04 end=218.67
Well, I do get frustrated either being human. All of us get frustrated. But I try to step into their shoes as to what really happened.  start= 218.68 end=225.21
Everybody's the way they handle pressure is different. Amount of pressure every individual can happen can,  start= 225.22 end=232.09
uh, deal with this different. So it's important to realise that and, you know, groom them so that you know, when you are there,  start= 232.12 end=237.57
they perform and you're not there. Still, they know how they need to perform. So we try to do that. Of course you know a chinchilla somebody who's experienced the other players who are experienced.  start= 237.58 end=245.57
So you don't worry a lot about them. You want them to take that responsibility. If they are confused, please come.  start= 245.59 end=251.09
You know, ask whatever you want to. But overall, you know, they have taken the responsibility brilliantly. I know your team is waiting there for you,  start= 251.11 end=256.99
but one of them has played his final game today. Well, you know. The special thing about radio is if he's on the field,  start= 259.76 end=265.66
he will give you 100%. The second thing is with him in the team. I will never win the fair play award because he reacts to quickly.  start= 265.67 end=272.33
But I think what I will remember him for is he always gives 100%. start=272.34 end=277.37
He wants to contribute. He has been a fantastic cricketer, you know, right from we played India it together,  start= 277.40 end=283.635
You know, we were part of that team where we played India together is somebody who played the spin and the fastball as equally well. start=283.965 end=290.545
So, you know, I always felt that in this game we will do something special. Uh,  start= 290.46 end=296.06
I'm very happy for him. You know, I feel this game will be one game that will remember for a very long time.  start= 296.07 end=301.32
He's also like me. You know, it doesn't use the phone a lot, but, you know, he had a fantastic career.  start= 301.35 end=306.69
What is important to enjoy it and get into the next phase of life. You're so hard at the other end.  start= 306.70 end=313.15
Good things happen to good people. And he said, maybe something better happen to him as today.  start= 313.19 end=318.28
all I'll say is well done. Thank you for all the joy you have given us. You and CSK have given us over the years and made never stop your teams waiting for,  start= 318.89 end=326.38
um s thanks a lot.  start= 326.38 end=327.47

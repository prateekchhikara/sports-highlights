Good afternoon, Scotty. Thank you for joining us before we open it up for questions. Is there anything you'd like to say to start?  start= 1.44 end=7.53
Um Yeah, yeah. First of all, you know, my sympathies go out to the family, Mr Mills. Um I,  start= 7.83 end=14.739
I can't imagine what, what they're going through this morning. Um You know, he, one day he's heading to the golf course and to watch a tournament and um,  start= 15.84 end=24.1
you know, a few moments later he's trying to cross the street and uh now he's no longer with us. So I can't, I can't imagine what they're going through my,  start= 25.67 end=31.61
my heart. You know, I feel for them. I'm sorry, my, my situation will get handled. It was just a uh it was a,  start= 32.10 end=37.38
it was a chaotic situation and a big uh big misunderstanding. And um I can't,  start= 37.40 end=42.45
I can't comment on any of the specifics of it. So I feel like y'all are gonna be disappointed but um I can't comment on any specifics,  start= 42.47 end=48.349
but my situation will be handled. It was just a uh just a big misunderstanding. So if y'all got any questions about the golf today,  start= 48.38 end=54.09
I'm happy to answer them. But outside of that. I can't really get into what, what transpired outside of. You know, my heart goes out to the family.  start= 54.85 end=60.139
Thanks Scotty. We'll open up for questions now. Starting with Marty. I'm Mike too. How do you encapsulate everything that happened to you today?  start= 61.28 end=68.05
I, I, I don't really know, I feel like my head is still spinning. I, I, I can't really explain what happened this morning. Um I did spend some time stretching in a jail cell.  start= 69.10 end=77.669
That was a first for me. You know, I was part of my warm up. I was just sitting there waiting and, you know, I started going through my warm up.  start= 77.83 end=82.94
I felt like there was a chance I may be able to still come out here and play. And so I started going through my routine and I tried to get my heart rate down as much as I could today.  start= 82.96 end=89.47
But like I said, you know, I still feel like my head's spinning a little bit. But, um, yeah, I was fortunate to be able to make it back out and,  start= 89.98 end=95.449
and play some golf today here on one Scotty. What was it like? Even making the decision to continue to compete today and shifting focus to the task at hand and coming out and shooting five under. start=99.58 end=106.529
Yeah. Well, like I said, it was just a,  start= 103.00 end=108.389
it's just a huge misunderstanding this morning that, that'll get resolved, I think fairly quickly. And, um, yeah,  start= 109.87 end=114.949
I mean, I, I came here for a golf tournament and I was, I was driving in this morning trying to get to my, my warm up time, um,  start= 115.19 end=120.9
and get ready for, for the round of golf. You know, I didn't really have an understanding of what, what had transpired this morning.  start= 121.15 end=126.25
Um, and, you know, my main focus after, you know, getting arrested was,  start= 126.71 end=131.77
you know, wondering if I could be able to come back out here and play and, you know, fortunately I was able to do that. And,  start= 131.92 end=136.97
um, yeah, it was nice to, to put together a solid, a solid round today for sure. Dan on 17, it,  start= 140.24 end=145.369
it seemed like the crowds were really behind you and your fellow players kind of rallied around you. Did you feel the support out there today?  start= 145.39 end=151.369
From your community? I, I, I really did, it was, it was, it was really nice. The fans were, were tremendous today.  start= 151.46 end=156.729
You know, I felt like they were cheering extra loud for me today. And it was, I mean, I really do, I, I know sometimes you can't really see it on my face,  start= 157.30 end=163.05
but I really do enjoy playing in front of the fans. Um The support I've been getting the last few months out here has been tremendous and I'm,  start= 163.07 end=168.77
I'm really grateful for it, Dylan on 18. How long did it take before the golf felt normal or did it feel normal at any point once you got out there. start=172.6 end=178.94
Um, you probably took a few holes to feel normal. You know, obviously I didn't have my normal,  start= 177.28 end=183.44
my normal warm up and I'm a pretty, uh, I usually stick to my routine. Um, I'm a big routine guy, especially when it comes to my preparation,  start= 185.13 end=191.449
but it, it took a few holes to settle in. And, um, you know, it was, it was kind of nice just to be out there inside the ropes competing.  start= 192.18 end=197.69
You know, it's, it's one of my favorite things in the world to do. And so I was fortunate to be able to come out here and do it again today right here,  start= 197.73 end=203.779
Mark, I'm for Scotty. We've come to know you as a pretty unflappable person out here not affected by a lot of stuff.  start= 203.81 end=210.279
Can you describe how rattled you were when you were and you just referenced, you know, being in a jail cell and whatnot,  start= 210.31 end=216.97
just describe that mindset and how surreal that was for you. Yeah, I was, I was, I was pretty rattled to say the least.  start= 217.18 end=222.589
Um, you know, I, the, the officer that took me to the um, to the jail was, was very kind.  start= 224.02 end=229.339
He was great. Um, you know, we had a nice chat in the car that kind of helped calm me down and I was sitting there waiting to kind of go in. I, I asked him,  start= 229.40 end=234.639
I was like, hey, excuse me, can you just come, can you just come hang out with me for a few minutes so I can calm down. And, uh, you know, my,  start= 235.37 end=240.38
I was, I was never, you know, angry. I was just in shock and I think my body was just, I was shaking the whole time.  start= 240.71 end=246.149
I was shaken for like an hour. It was, it was definitely a new feeling for me. And he came out and we had a nice chat and then the,  start= 246.19 end=251.74
the officers inside the jail were tremendous. A couple of them made some jokes. I think when they figured out, you know who I was and what happened and you know how I ended up there,  start= 252.45 end=260.609
you know, they, uh this one, this one older officer looked at me as I was doing like my fingerprints or whatever and he,  start= 260.65 end=267.959
he looks at me, he goes, so do you want the full experience today? And I kind of looked at him. I was like, I don't know how to answer that.  start= 269.80 end=274.97
And he's like, come on, man, you want a sandwich? And I was like, sure I'll take a sandwich. I didn't eat breakfast yet. And so, I mean, they were really kind.  start= 275.55 end=280.73
I, I'm, I'm grateful to have, uh I'm grateful that we have, you know, such strong police and you know,  start= 280.79 end=285.929
there, there are protectors out there and, you know, like I said, we just got into a chaotic situation this morning.  start= 285.98 end=291.63
That's really all it was Mike six, Jim. Thanks Scotty in terms of the ability to compartmentalize.  start= 291.70 end=298.07
How difficult was that challenge for you today? Once you got on the, on the course? Yeah, like I said, you know, my body was,  start= 298.91 end=304.69
I, I was shaking, you know, almost, I, I would say in shock and in fear and so um coming out here and trying to play today was definitely a challenge, start=306.559 end=312.13
but I did my best to, you know, control my mind, control my breathing and,  start= 310.36 end=316.579
uh, you know, basically just calm down. So I come out here and try and play golf. You know, I knew there was gonna be a lot of distractions, but I didn't really know what the reception would be like.  start= 317.34 end=324.95
And, um, to be honest with you, it was, it was great having the fans behind me, you know, they cheered for me really loud. It was, I felt like they were really,  start= 325.55 end=331.309
really glad to have me out competing today. And, um, you know, it was, it was, uh, it was a nice day to come out here and compete over to Doug on five.  start= 331.74 end=339.049
Is there any concern? I mean, it's been a, a huge rush from, you know, six o'clock this morning that when you have the afternoon and you have the night to kind of process this,  start= 339.13 end=347.299
how it will affect you going into the weekend. Um, you know, I'm gonna go back to my, my normal routine now, you know,  start= 348.42 end=353.579
I'm, I may go practice a touch this afternoon. Depending on my energy levels after I eat and then I'll probably go into the gym,  start= 353.61 end=359.239
go through my movements and then see my trainer and, um, go home and get some rest. So as far as the rest of the week goes,  start= 359.28 end=364.609
I'm, you know, I'm gonna do my best to kind of continue to calm down from this morning, you know, continue to get my heart rate down and,  start= 364.66 end=371.45
uh, yeah, get ready for, uh, for a long weekend. What was, I'm just curious, what was your level of concern that, that you wouldn't make it back out here today?  start= 372.05 end=379.47
What was going through your head? I mean, I, I didn't really know, I was just so confused at what was happening at the time that,  start= 381.29 end=386.529
you know, I, I didn't know what time it was. I didn't know what was going on but, um, when I was sitting in like the, the holding cell or whatever,  start= 386.80 end=392.25
I was, there was a TV there and I could see myself on the TV, on ESPN and it was get up was on and so in the corner it showed the time and they said they were delayed and I was kind of thinking about my tt I was like, start=395.399 end=402.41
well, maybe, you know, I, I could be able to get out,  start= 399.40 end=404.88
you know, the, the officers downstairs and, uh, you know, they were, they were discussing how long it was gonna take me to get released,  start= 406.15 end=411.48
you know, obviously, you have to go through all, all the due process and everything and, um, you know, I was able to kind of see a bit of the TV and,  start= 411.55 end=417.1
you know, then I laid down and then I started to stretch a little bit once I got my heart rate down a little bit up the mic 16. start=417.529 end=423.089
Uh, Scotty. You did, you, did it ever cross your mind with shaking stuff that, um, voluntarily not playing today and maybe going home or,  start= 424.03 end=431.649
and uh, and uh, yeah, did I ever cross your mind? Not really, no. Did any members of your team tell you anything today to like calm you down,  start= 432.48 end=440.66
just kind of reset before you went out? Um Yeah, like I said, I was, I was in shock and so I was,  start= 440.86 end=446.25
I was shaking and it took me a little while, you know, in the car on the way over here to kind of calm down, but my manager was in the car and 22 gentlemen from the,  start= 446.48 end=452.92
from the club were, were in the car with me. Um And yeah, we were able to,  start= 453.16 end=458.45
to talk, have a nice chat. Um, you know, they were, uh, I mean, I'm, I'm not really going to get into the details of that either.  start= 460.72 end=466.519
But um, yeah, I was able to have a nice chat there. I got here, I gave my mom and dad a hug. You know, my, uh my coach Randy was there Blake was there,  start= 466.89 end=473.97
you know, my whole team was, was there for me, you know, in a moment where I really needed him. Uh, especially to, like I said,  start= 474.30 end=479.73
I, I was in, I was in such shock at what was happening that I think, you know, I, I really, I didn't, I didn't stop shaking for a while just because it was,  start= 479.99 end=486.399
it was a chaotic situation. And, uh, yeah, my team, I, I, I leaned on them pretty heavily this morning to kind of get me into the right frame of mind to where I could go out and play right back here to mic 14, start=491.049 end=497.489
Scotty with, with your ability to focus on the course.  start= 495.15 end=500.35
Was it actually a relief that you had around to play? I, I think for sure it was nice to be able to get inside the ropes and do what I love to do.  start= 501.01 end=507.45
You know, I love competing out here on tour. I love playing the major championships and, um, you know, I've, I've kept myself in the tournament now with a pretty chaotic day and so I'm gonna go from here and focus on getting some rest and recovery and getting ready for, start=512.309 end=519.179
uh, for a grind of the last two days.  start= 514.86 end=520.69
And, um, we'll see how the leaderboard shakes out. But, um, yeah, hopefully I won't be too far back, going in tomorrow, back to Marty at two.  start= 522.07 end=527.679
imagine the last thing you thought you'd be doing this morning. Was sitting in the back of a cop car cuffed within the shock and the fear and the confusion of that moment. start=531.69 end=539.609
What do you recall were some of the things that were spinning and racing through your mind?  start= 536.71 end=544.96
I was just, I mean, I was just really confused. I was doing my best to, to, uh, to diffuse the situation really.  start= 548.06 end=554.309
Um And yeah, I was just sitting there just trying to remain as calm as possible. Like I said,  start= 554.34 end=559.419
it was, it was pretty chaotic with what had happened this morning. I mean, once again, you know, I can't imagine what the, what the family is going through.  start= 559.49 end=565.2
Um But like I said, I was doing my best to, to diffuse whatever was going on. And so I was just sitting there in the back of the car,  start= 565.95 end=571.869
just listen to the police officer is, you know, he's trying to figure out who I am, figure out my name.  start= 572.01 end=577.33
Um They were trying to find me in the system, but there was something wrong with my, with going across state lines with the social security number and stuff like that.  start= 578.14 end=584.32
So it was all around. It was a very, very confusing and chaotic situation, but, you know, I did my best to just follow instructions and um do as I was told as I was sitting there handcuffed up to Mike 18, start=588.65 end=595.179
Scott. Did you ever say it to someone this morning?  start= 591.14 end=598.609
Like I'm Scottie Scheffler? No, um when, when they got me out of the car,  start= 600.13 end=605.26
I, you know, I, uh like I said, it was very chaotic and, you know, I said,  start= 605.92 end=611.169
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get to my tee time and outside of that it was then it just things,  start= 611.19 end=616.2
you know, escalated from there. I did uh you know, numerous apologies and whatever, but like I said, it was, it was chaotic,  start= 617.05 end=622.599
it's dark, it's raining, you know, there's a lot of stuff going on. They, they just had an accident. I didn't know what had happened at the time other than there was an accident,  start= 622.73 end=629.64
I didn't know that it was, it was fatal. And um yeah, like I said, my heart goes out to the family but no,  start= 629.69 end=635.63
at no point did I did I try to name drop myself to diffuse the situation. I just tried to remain as calm as possible and um you know,  start= 635.65 end=642.53
just follow instructions over to Mike nine. At what point did you feel as if you were definitely going to make your tee time?  start= 642.57 end=650.049
Or there would be some kind of exception made. Um I didn't really feel like I would make my tee time until one of the officers at the jail came by my holding cell and knocked on the window and said, start=654.19 end=660.109
let's go. And uh he said, get ready and I like in motion like this to start rolling out my mat.  start= 657.79 end=665.559
And so then I poked my head at the TV. And I was like, oh, I might, might be able to get there. We'll see how bad, you know, the traffic is getting in and out. But like I said,  start= 665.65 end=671.559
I'm just sitting there, I don't really know what's going on. I don't really know what was going on out here. I didn't know how long the delay was.  start= 671.60 end=676.64
I mean, at the time I couldn't even remember what my original tee time was. So I was just trying to do my best to stay calm.  start= 676.67 end=682.119
And when they, you know, when they took me out and we got in the car on the way here, figured it was ready to play. And my manager asked me if I wanted to and I was like,  start= 682.26 end=688.64
of course, and then we just came here and got ready to go play. Got time for one more.  start= 689.83 end=695.469
We'll go up to Mike 19 Scotty, just on the detail. How long were you actually in the cell for?  start= 695.50 end=701.13
And in the context of everything else where among the best rounds of your career would be, start=701.14 end=706.489
uh 66 after getting arrested. Yeah, I, I couldn't tell you how long I was in there. Uh You know, you don't have access to,  start= 707.05 end=712.739
I wasn't wearing a watch or didn't have access to my phone. So I didn't really, I couldn't tell you how long I was in there.  start= 712.92 end=718.03
But, um, like I said, the, the officers at the jail were, were tremendous you know, I, I'm very grateful for,  start= 718.17 end=723.63
you know, the people that serve, you know, all of us across the nation. And, um, as far as best rounds of my career,  start= 725.77 end=731.75
I would say it was, it was pretty, it was pretty good, you know, I, I, I definitely never imagined ever going to jail and I definitely never imagined going to jail the morning before, start=734.559 end=740.4
uh, you know, one of my tee times for sure. But,  start= 738.18 end=743.349
um, yeah, like I said, I was, I was grateful to be able to go out there and compete, you know. Um, and yeah,  start= 745.81 end=751.08
it was definitely, it was, it was a nice round of golf. My heart goes out to the family. Um, but outside of that, yeah,  start= 751.90 end=756.94
I'm glad to be out here competing and doing what I love. Thanks for your time, Scotty.  start= 757.29 end=760.46

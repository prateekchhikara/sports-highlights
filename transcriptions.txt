thanks. Good afternoon. Welcome to the press conference for Andy Murray. Please. Uh, raise your hand and state your organisation.  start= 2.52 end=8.34
When asking your question, we'll just start. And you've had some good preparation coming in. How are you feeling?  start= 8.38 end=13.42
Uh, ahead of the fortnight. Yeah, I feel good. Um, yeah. I've obviously played lots of matches. Um,  start= 14.35 end=19.95
yeah. Physically been feeling good and Yeah, ready to go? and rob from the sun. I don't know if you believe in omens.  start= 22.33 end=28.11
The last time you played a British guy in the first round the trophy. Oh, brilliant. Oh, great. So can we start celebrating that?  start= 30.58 end=37.09
do you believe in omens And And generally just talk about Ryan plays as well. Um, yeah, I I don't really,  start= 41.94 end=47.4
but yeah. I mean, I actually have not played against many Brits, um, at Wimbledon before,  start= 47.45 end=53.779
um Maybe that was I don't know that maybe it was the last time that happened. start=53.79 end=59.799
Or maybe the only time. I'm not sure how many Brits have played, but, um Yeah,  start= 60.54 end=65.989
Ryan, Um, I know him pretty well. We practise together quite a lot. Um,  start= 66.20 end=71.269
he obviously likes playing on the grass courts. He had some some really good wins last year. Um,  start= 72.55 end=77.959
you know, at Queens and also some of the, you know. Jack Draper and Surbiton.  start= 80.10 end=85.3
And, you know, I think he beat Holger and Eastbourne. So now he's had some some good winds on on the surface.  start= 85.43 end=92.98
Um Yeah, Lefty. Um, yeah. Moves moves very well,  start= 93.15 end=98.23
and Um, yeah. I need to, you know, I need to need to be ready for that one.  start= 99.00 end=104.18
OK. Hi. And I'm sure you saw Andre dense comments last week about Saudi Arabia. start=107.269 end=113.43
I know. So he said, the A P are in talks to play in Saudi Arabia.  start= 114.75 end=120.589
In the past, you've said that you wouldn't play there if there was a tournament there. Would you stick to that approach or might you reconsider?  start= 121.07 end=130.1
Well, yeah. I mean, in the past, when you know we were asked to go and play there, it was,  start= 131.07 end=136.798
you know, we were asked to go and play exhibition tournaments. Um you know,  start= 137.32 end=145.5
if they become, like, major tournaments on the tour, Um,  start= 145.54 end=150.789
you know, it becomes it becomes a slightly different question, and it's a difficult one, really.  start= 151.16 end=156.69
Um you know, based on how the tour and the rankings and everything work.  start= 156.71 end=163.36
And you know how important they are to get into other events and stuff when you start missing them, start=163.369 end=168.679
Um, you obviously get penalised for that. So, yeah, it's definitely something I would have to, you know,  start= 170.07 end=175.21
I would have to to think about, and unfortunately, it's the way that, you know, a lot of sports seem to be going now.  start= 175.44 end=181.479
and Tom Hopkinson from The Sunday Mirror. you've obviously enjoyed some good form in recent weeks and months.  start= 184.09 end=189.46
But at this stage of your career, when you come into a tournament like this is the mindset almost that you just have to throw the kitchen sink at it.  start= 189.48 end=195.869
Yeah. Um, And to be honest, that also would have been my mentality most years coming into Wimbledon, start=200.759 end=207.27
to be honest, um You know,  start= 204.48 end=210.509
it's always been the most important tournament for me in the year. So, you know,  start= 210.54 end=215.649
regardless of how I was feeling coming in, I would always do my best to, you know, be ready for this one.  start= 216.46 end=222.369
Even if there was some physical issues niggles And what have you that you know, I always yeah,  start= 222.39 end=228.899
give my best, but yeah, you do feel like, obviously as you get towards the latter stage of your career that you want to make the most of these opportunities because you don't know how many more times I'll be here Bur Hi, start=231.699 end=242.13
Andy. Um, Rafa announcing sort of a farewell tour next year.  start= 240.66 end=246.36
I know this is a difficult one for you to answer for a number of different reasons, but I heard you talking about the the Paris Olympics.  start= 246.38 end=251.899
Maybe next year do you plan to play a full schedule for for 2024? And if and when it does come to announce your kind of retirement plans,  start= 251.92 end=259.6
would you do it like Rafa did and do it a year in advance sort of thing? Um, I I don't think so. Um Yeah,  start= 260.35 end=267.85
I I don't think so. I mean, I have an idea in my head of when I would when I would like to stop, Um But,  start= 268.73 end=276.519
you know, that's not That's not definitive. You know, a lot of that is just, you know, I think it is is good to,  start= 276.87 end=283.22
you know, to do that So you can start planning, um, a little bit, Um But Yeah,  start= 284.37 end=290.589
I I don't think I would I don't think I would announce anything like way, way ahead of time,  start= 290.61 end=296.309
because, well, I want to play as long as I can whilst I'm, you know, whilst I'm still feeling good physically and,  start= 297.12 end=302.929
you know, competitive. Um But I'm aware, based on you know, how my last sort of 56 years have gone that things can change very quickly.  start= 303.48 end=312.579
Um, as well. So, um, you know, I'm keeping an open mind to that, but yeah, I do.  start= 313.30 end=318.369
Do have an idea of when I would when I'd like to stop. Yeah. anytime soon. I'm not planning on stopping, um,  start= 321.46 end=326.779
after I've won the tournament here. Obviously, my question is a bit irrelevant cos you're gonna win the tournament. But,  start= 329.62 end=334.709
um and that's your goal. You wanna win every match, But in this sort of physical condition,  start= 335.02 end=340.679
you are now the age you are at and and what's happened to you over the last few years sitting there right now. start=340.69 end=346.899
short of winning it. What would you leave this tournament happy with? What do you think is the minimum you could achieve right now and and would be happy with?  start= 348.29 end=356.85
I mean, a lot of it comes down to how you like your your performance, like you know,  start= 359.15 end=364.5
depending on draws and situations and everything, like it's possible to play poorly and make the quarter finals. start=367.829 end=373.26
Like if I was to play Novak in the second round and I lost in five sets or whatever, start=373.269 end=378.399
like I can't say,  start= 375.10 end=380.299
I would walk away from the tournament and be really disappointed if I performed how I'd still think that I can. start=380.309 end=385.97
And that's what I want to do at this tournament. I want to go out there and perform at a level that, um,  start= 386.50 end=391.54
you know, I'm happy with, um you know, I I do feel like I'm in a really, really good position to do that.  start= 391.76 end=398.29
Um, I have the experience at this tournament and, you know, playing on the big courts here,  start= 398.92 end=405.089
Um, more than well, there's only one player in the draw that has more experience of, you know, of playing,  start= 405.83 end=411.809
um, playing here than me which is Novak. Um and yeah,  start= 411.85 end=417.369
I'd be I actually don't know this for sure, but maybe we'll certainly be one of the only players that's won against him here. start=420.7 end=425.809
Um, as well. And you know,  start= 422.53 end=428.22
I need to use that to my advantage and use my experience. Um, you know, to to my advantage and and take confidence from that.  start= 428.75 end=436.22
Um, because I do believe I'm one of the best grass court players in the world, and I'm physically feeling really good.  start= 436.78 end=442.94
And I'm prepared. Well, um, so there's no reason why why I can't have a good tournament. uh, Michael Wa off from radio News hub.  start= 444.99 end=451.85
What emotions are stirred in you when you come back here? What does this place mean to you when you walk through the gates every year?  start= 452.23 end=458.489
Um, I I to be honest, it's more like walking out onto Centre Court again or going out to play your match.  start= 459.45 end=465.94
Like I I come here a lot during the during the year. Fortunately, I'm I'm a member here, so I sometimes come to to train or go to the gym or whatever.  start= 467.21 end=475.66
And, um, yeah, I feel very comfortable. Um, you know, in in these surroundings,  start= 476.25 end=481.589
I I love coming to to play the tournament here and Yeah, when I walk out onto Centre Court to,  start= 481.61 end=487.89
you know, to play it. You know, it's obviously I'm very nervous, but, you know, incredibly excited to to get the chance to perform here again.  start= 488.24 end=496.089
Um, on you know, one of the you know, if not the most special court you know,  start= 496.13 end=502.609
in our sport. So, yeah, I always really look forward to it and Yeah,  start= 502.77 end=508.94
Um, I'm feeling already, like, a couple of days out from the tournament. You know, I feel a bit a bit nervous and stuff,  start= 509.19 end=514.59
which is, you know, always a really positive sign for me. Um, when I feel that way,  start= 514.64 end=519.669
so Yeah, Hopefully that bodes well for the event. going back a few years.  start= 523.08 end=529.239
Uh, when you hired Emily as your coach, there was some thought that perhaps that might spark other.  start= 529.27 end=535.679
players, uh, in the men's game and the women's game to hire female coaches. Just wondering what your thoughts are on the way.  start= 537.01 end=544.809
That didn't necessarily happen. Uh, surprised. Disappointed, Uh Maybe you haven't noticed,  start= 546.08 end=553.59
but, uh, just on the fact that there haven't been a lot of female coaches in men's or women, start=554.219 end=560.34
I mean, it is It's strange. Yeah, um is that I I I'm probably surprised that that yeah, start=563.219 end=569.76
I'm surprised that there's not more female coaches across both tours. start=569.77 end=575.119
Um I I didn't necessarily think at the time that it was for sure gonna spark, start=575.13 end=581.979
like loads of, um, you know,  start= 579.79 end=584.919
new or more female cultures to come into the game. It wasn't exactly received,  start= 584.94 end=590.5
like, unbelievably well at the time, Um and yeah,  start= 590.53 end=596.059
So I I wasn't necessarily expecting that, Um But yeah,  start= 596.23 end=602.63
it's probably slightly more sort of deeper rooted, I guess, than just at the top of the game.  start= 602.66 end=608.76
I think it's probably the case throughout. you know, throughout throughout the sport. Um, that probably starts from from the bottom up.  start= 610.65 end=617.289
So, um yeah, probably need to do a much better job of getting and encouraging,  start= 617.32 end=624.14
you know, more female coaches to, you know, to get into the sport. Um, you know, at the lower levels first and then hopefully that transitions on to the,  start= 624.38 end=633.76
you know, the the men's and women's tour is a bit more, but it's, um I don't even know that it would be a handful of female coaches across both tours, start=637.44 end=643.9
which Yeah, is is not enough.  start= 641.14 end=647.549
Andy. You mentioned Novak before, as the only player out there who's really his contemporary from start to where he is today. start=651.78 end=657.77
What's your perspective on what he's done and what he's still doing?  start= 655.87 end=661.75
Yeah. I mean, it's incredible what he's what he's achieved. Um you know.  start= 662.99 end=669.359
to to have passed. Um, Rafa and Roger and the Grand Slam.  start= 670.80 end=676.799
You know, title chase, whatever you want to call it. Um, yeah, is amazing. And,  start= 678.26 end=683.39
you know, I think if you look back sort of 8 to 10 years, like the numbers and sort of how far away he was,  start= 683.42 end=689.7
um, from them and and what he's gone on to to achieve in this sort of the latter stages of his career, start=690.869 end=697.049
um, you know, has been been incredible and, you know, also doesn't look like he's,  start= 696.75 end=702.26
you know, he's slowing down. I think what he did at the French Open was, um, you know, it was phenomenal.  start= 703.68 end=708.9
Um, you know, brilliant performance. you know, against Alcaraz in the semi finals.  start= 710.34 end=715.979
Um, and then? Yeah, just very clinical. Um, you know, considering how much you know was on the line,  start= 717.01 end=723.52
and I think Yeah. The thing that yeah you have to admire about, you know about him is that he's been very clear on what it is that he wants to achieve and,  start= 723.76 end=732.32
you know, trying to get that, um, you know, Grand Slam record. And when he put himself in a position to do that,  start= 732.65 end=740.729
like, you know, he delivered, you know he didn't. He didn't look like he was getting nervous or overthinking it or any of those things. start=745.03 end=750.13
And yeah, he went, went and did it. And, you know, it shows the strength of character that he's got.  start= 747.81 end=755.19
Andy, Um, you were practising with Nova earlier today. I just wondered, how did that come about? Um how do you think it went?  start= 757.90 end=763.489
And also, when was the last time you shared a call with him? Um And how did you see your level? Um, yeah,  start= 765.24 end=770.309
I did well in the practise. Um, the last time we pressed together was the Laver Cup,  start= 771.00 end=777.08
But before then, it had been quite a long time. I can't remember exactly when it was, but it was. Yeah,  start= 778.50 end=783.76
maybe it was in Australia when I was Yeah, start=784.58 end=789.75
when I was having the issues with my hip, I think it was probably then was the last time and where I am today in comparison to where I was. start=791.71 end=797.979
Then there's yeah, night and day from a physical and just mental perspective and my enjoyment of the game.  start= 796.06 end=804.2
And you know how I'm still able to compete with, you know. those guys. Um,  start= 805.71 end=810.89
you know, I I didn't feel like I could really, um back then, so Yeah.  start= 811.08 end=817.0
Happy to be in, you know, in in that position. Still, and yeah, I really enjoyed it. We we used to practise together quite a lot,  start= 817.57 end=823.64
actually. Um, you know, a lot of the top players? Certainly. Um, I never practised with Roger after 2007.  start= 825.05 end=834.7
Um, R I would practise with sometimes, but I don't think Ralph and Novak really ever trained with each other,  start= 835.39 end=841.049
but yeah, me and Novak always practised with each other even when we were competing. you know, for for grand slams and stuff.  start= 842.25 end=848.75
Um, so, yeah, it was nice to be back on the court with them again. Hi, Andy. Just going back to what you said about having a stop date in your own mind is whenever that might be is the principle the concept of having that end date is that important to you in terms of being able to put yourself through what you have to physically, start=854.799 end=871.4
to to be able to compete and make the sacrifices that you have to in terms of time away from family? start=871.409 end=876.64
Does it need to not be infinite in your mind in order to do that?  start= 872.88 end=881.14
Yeah, there's Yeah, there's a bit of that. And, you know, I started to think about it. Um, actually,  start= 881.59 end=886.799
during the Australian Open this year, like after the matches I was having, I was like,  start= 887.83 end=892.919
um I'm not. You know this Maybe isn't that good for me?  start= 892.94 end=898.109
Like long term to be playing those sorts of matches? Um and yeah, that I'm like I could keep doing that.  start= 898.14 end=905.479
Probably, I don't know. Until the hip. finishes. Um, you know, and I I don't really want to do that.  start= 907.16 end=914.03
Um, you know, I want to finish on my terms when you know I'm fit and healthy and still competing at, start=915.309 end=922.76
you know, at a good level. Um, you know, I would like to to finish in in that way rather than it being,  start= 921.89 end=929.169
like, you know, an injury. And I know you can't control that, um, entirely,  start= 929.59 end=934.729
um, but yeah, I do feel like I've, you know, still got a you know, a period of time left where I'm going to be able to dedicate,  start= 936.30 end=943.539
you know, the the physical work and the training on the court to allow me to still perform.  start= 943.75 end=948.94
you know, the the highest level, but yeah, that that can That can't go on forever, unfortunately. Thank you.  start= 951.91 end=957.08
Thank you. Thanks. yes.  start= 960.02 end=961.359
